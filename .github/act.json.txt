# Working with artifact locally
# If you are using nektos/act with actions/upload-artifact and actions/download-artifact, artifact server is already implemented in act 
# To be able to download or upload artifact locally, we can run act with --artifact-server-path where you want to store the artifacts.
# mkdir /tmp/artifacts
# act pull_request -e act.json --artifact-server-path /tmp/artifacts
# The artifact will then be downloaded in the specified path on your local machine
# You can also add --artifact-server-path /tmp/artifacts in the local .actrc file so you do not need to specify argument every time in the terminal
